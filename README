BurntSushi's Fork
=================
I've forked the XGB repository from Google Code due to inactivty upstream.

Much of the code has been rewritten in an effort to support thread safety
and multiple extensions. Namely, go_client.py has been thrown away in favor
of an xgbgen package.

The biggest parts that *haven't* been rewritten by me are the connection and
authentication handshakes. They're inherently messy, and there's really no
reason to re-work them.

I like to release my code under the WTFPL, but since I'm starting with someone
else's work, I'm leaving the original license/contributor/author information
in tact.

I suppose I can legitimately release xgbgen under the WTFPL.

What follows is the original README:
